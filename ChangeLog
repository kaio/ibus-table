commit c43c22e8088f0da92ee8a187f3bfe0438addef34
Author: Mike FABIAN <mfabian@redhat.com>
Date:   Wed Aug 25 12:31:40 2021 +0200

    If an exception happens when trying to play a sound, catch it.
    
    This bug has been reported:
    
    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1995955
    Bug 1995955 - [abrt] ibus-table: play_buffer(): shiny.py:60:play_buffer:_simpleaudio.SimpleaudioError: Error opening PCM device. -- CODE: -24 -- MSG: 開啟太多檔案
    
    (開啟太多檔案 = Too many files open)
    
    I have no idea how to reproduce that but catching the exception should
    fix it, it should make ibus-table continue working normally if any
    such serious problem with playing sounds occurs. Without sound of course
    but it should not stop working.

Date:   Wed Aug 25 12:24:01 2021 +0200

    When changing the error sound file with the setup tool, play it
    
    To make the user hear immediately what kind of sound was selected.

    Small adjustment to one of the latex test cases
    
    To make it work with both with ibus-table-others-1.3.12 *and*
    ibus-table-others-1.3.11. The latex.txt table in ibus-table-others-1.3.12 has
    
    SELECT_KEYS = F1,F2,F3,F4,F5,F6,F7,F8,F9,F10
    
    the older version in ibus-table-others-1.3.11 has
    
    SELECT_KEYS = F1,F2,F3,F4,F5,F6,F7,F8,F9
    
    The default page size is calculated from the number of select keys,
    to make this test work for both versions, set the page size to 9 in
    the test.

    Adapt the test case to the new default keybinding for commit_to_preedit
    
    Adapting this test case is also necessary because Shift_L now commits
    English input and then switches to direct mode.

commit 0574308f10e6c7b9a3e9e0a79ed69e24bfe3b127
Author: Mike FABIAN <mfabian@redhat.com>

    Change the default keybinding for commit_to_preedit to ['Control+Shift_L', 'Control+Shift_R']
    
    Related: https://github.com/kaio/ibus-table/issues/68
    
    The previous default had a conflict with toggle_input_mode_on_off
    and toggle_pinyin_mode:
    
        commit_to_preedit               ['Shift_R', 'Shift_L']
        toogle_input_mode_on_off        ['Shift_L']
        toggle_pinyin_mode              ['Shift_R']
    
    This conflict didn’t matter as the toggling of the modes was only done
    when the preedit was empty and commit_to_preedit can only be done
    when the preedit is not empty. So there was no real conflict in practice.
    But now when toggle_input_mode_on_off is also done when the preedit is
    not empty to fix https://github.com/kaio/ibus-table/issues/68, then
    it is not possible to use the same keybindings for these commands.
    
    commit_to_preedit is probably used much more rarely than toggling the
    input or the pinyin modes. So it is probably better to leave the
    default keybindinds for toggling the input and pinyin modes as they
    always were and change the default keybinding of commit_to_preedit.

    Update ibus-table.pot (Only line numbers changed)

commit 7a090b62d8661c9b7debd0385a54c59ccf598a3d

    In main.py “import factory” only when the --xml option is not used
    
    “import factory” is only needed in IMApp and not when using “python3
    main.py --xml”.  And importing factory imports other stuff which
    imports Gtk and that needs a display. By moving to import of factory
    to where it is really needed it becomes possible to use the --xml option
    in an environment where there is no display without getting an error
    message like this:
    
       $ env -u DISPLAY python3 main.py --xml
       Unable to init server: Could not connect: Connection refused
    
    The --xml option is used by “ibus write-cache” which is used during
    rpm updates and then there is often no display and the above error
    message appears.

    Return False in _execute_command_commit_candidate_number(self, number) if number out of range
    
    Was reported as an issue in ibus-table-others with the ipa-x-sampa table.
    But it is actually and ibus-table bug.
    
    When using a keybinding to commit a candidate with a certain number,
    ibus-table crashed when the number was out of range of the currently
    displayed lookup table.

    Use “from unittest import mock” instead of just “import mock”.
    
    Since Python 3.3, mock is part of unittest in the standard
    library. The third-party `mock` library is a backport for older Python
    versions.
    
    This makes it possible to remove the “BuildRequires:  python3-mock”
    from the ibus-table.spec file.

    Add buttons to move key bindings for a command up or down
    
    The order of key bindings for a certain command may matter a bit in some cases.
    
    For example, currently the first key binding for the command
    “commit_candidate_<number>” is used to label the candidate
    with that number in the lookup table.

    Remove “spacekeybehavior” option
    
    Now all keybindings are configurable. Therefore, the option to choose
    the behaviour of the space key makes no sense anymore.
    
    In the setup tool, there is now a new tab to configure all the keybindings,
    one can configure the behaviour of the space key there as well.

    Make key bindings configurable
    
    Only via the command line for the moment, not yet easy to do for
    normal users. I have to rewrite the setup tool eventually to make that
    possible.
    
    Resolves: https://github.com/ibus/ibus/issues/2241
    
    This rewrite of the handling of the key bindings also fixes the
    problem reported in https://github.com/ibus/ibus/issues/2241
    that the Shift_L key cannot switch between Chinese and English mode
    when using google-chrome.

    Merge Editor class into TabEngine class
    
    It makes no sense to have an extra class “Editor” when TabEngine needs
    to access most internals of the Editor class all the time.

    Before set_up() returns False it needs to call tear_down()
    
    This is necessary to call the stop() functions of the patchers.
    
    Because if setUp() of a test case decides to skip, tearDown() is
    apparently not called.

    Make output of ibus-table-createdb deterministic
    
    With this patch, the output of ibus-table-createdb would be of determined order as proposed by the Reproducible Builds project (https://reproducible-builds.org/).
    
    Downstream Debian bug report can be found at https://bugs.debian.org/797521 .
    
    Even though python's dict has become ordered since Python 3.6+, a `sorted()` function would be harmless and benefit users of Python 3.5, like users of Debian 9.

    Restructure input mode, pinyin mode, suggestion mode

commit e35a4fe5f64da55300c4966f2994f4d95d0f4e1a

    Fix problems with property menus
    
    Property menus were behaving strangely sometimes.  For example, when
    choosing pinyin mode in the property menu, then moving the focus to a
    client window and typing in pinyin, then opening the pinyin property
    menu again, it showed table mode, not pinyin mode. Although the real
    mode was pinyin mode.
    
    Fix the property menu handling by making the code as similar as
    possible with the property menu handling in ibus-typing-booster. The
    property menu handling code in ibus-typing-booster code has several
    bugs fixed, and it is easier to maintain.

commit 42134fe0ffc6d7c170c11d183d9294113af5f70c
Author: Mike FABIAN <mfabian@redhat.com>
Date:   Mon Jan 6 19:39:04 2020 +0100

    Move MockEngine classes into a separate file and make test_itb.py runnable standalone
    
    Now one can directly run ./test_it.py
    
    Use TAPTestRunner() instead of TextTestRunner(), but only when tap.py
    is installed.

    Add ibus-table.its and ibus-table.loc to avoid making the release descriptions and
     developer name in ibus-table.appdata.xml translatable
    
    Translating all the release notes would be too much for the
    translators, I think.
    
    So I added ibus-table.its and ibus-table.loc to ibus-table.
    Ibus-table’s ibus-table.its differs from the upstream
    /usr/share/gettext/its/metainfo.its like this:

    Migrate IBusConfig to GSettings
    
    IBus plans to deprecate IBusConfig and suggests to migrate to GSettings.
    https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/ibus-devel/Mu1IoFX-bKE
    
    The old settings are unfortunately lost, so one has to open the setup
    tool and recreate ones favourite settings.
    
    Fix some minor bugs while doing the migration:
    
    - Use 4 as the default Chinese mode, not -1. 4 means no special
      filtering and sorting at all, which is appropriate for non-Chinese
      tables as well.

    Do not read the dconf key lookuptableselectkeys
    
    There is no such option in the setup tool anyway, it makes no sense
    to read this from a dconf key if the setup tool doesn’t support it.
    
    The select keys come only from the table headers.

    Add IBus.KEY_KP_Prior and IBus.KEY_KP_Next to the default page-up and page-down keys
    
    These have the same numerical value, so it is not really necessary to
    add them to self._page_up_keys and self._page_down_keys:
    
    src/ibuskeysyms.h:#define IBUS_KEY_KP_Prior 0xff9a
    src/ibuskeysyms.h:#define IBUS_KEY_KP_Page_Up 0xff9a
    src/ibuskeysyms.h:#define IBUS_KEY_KP_Next 0xff9b
    src/ibuskeysyms.h:#define IBUS_KEY_KP_Page_Down 0xff9b
    
    it is for clarity only.

    Add some debug code to see whether _phrases_cache is handled correctly
    
    It needs to be reset when changing the Chinese mode. And stuff committed
    to the user database needs to be removed.
    
    Can be tested using the SmartCangJie6 table (scj6.txt) because this table uses
    both
    
        USER_CAN_DEFINE_PHRASE = FALSE
    
    and
    
        DYNAMIC_ADJUST = FALSE
    
    so no tabkeys are ever removed individually from _phrases_cache but
    _phrases_cache is reset to empty when the Chinese mode is changed (or
    when other settings influencing the caching like onechar mode or
    wildcard characters are changed).

    Load .desktop file for ibus-setup-table correctly under Gnome Wayland

commit 4cf3f6d8490392de28c7fdc311d8e4e782dcd0b7
Author: Mike FABIAN <mfabian@redhat.com>
Date:   Thu Feb 23 05:11:25 2017 +0100

    Set WM_CLASS of ibus-setup-table correctly
    
    This is needed to get the application name and icon shown correctly by
    gnome-shell in the top bar.
    
    gnome-shell seems to use the first argument of set_wmclass() to find
    the .desktop file.  If the .desktop file can be found, the name shown
    by gnome-shell in the top bar comes from that .desktop file and the
    icon to show is also read from that .desktop file. If the .desktop
    file cannot be found, the second argument of set_wmclass() is shown by
    gnome-shell in the top bar.
    
    Therefore, for ibus-setup-typing-table we need:
    
        set_wmclass('ibus-setup-table', 'IBus Table Setup')

    Unbreak sqlite on Python 3.6
    
    Resolves: rhbz#1413580 - [abrt] ibus-table: __init__(): factory.py:96:do_create_engine:Exception: Cannot create engine wubi-jidian86
    See: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1413580
    
    Py3.6 changed the transaction behavior; DDL commands like PRAGMA do not
    commit open transactions anymore, and since the default for execute() is
    to auto-open a transaction, setting the journal_mode fails.
    
    Changing the isolation_level to None so that transactions aren't opened
    anymore is a possible workaround. However, using executescript() seems
    like a better idea; it always commits any open transaction first.
    
    Jan Alexander Steffens (heftig) <jan.steffens@gmail.com> submitted
    this patch for ibus-typing-booster, ibus-table needs this as well
    to run with Python >= 3.6.

    Avoid running initialization code of ibus_table_location.py
    
    The code refactoring which placed "import ibus_table_location" at the start of
    this script caused regression for distribution use of this ibus-table-createdb
    script where there is no gurantee that the HOME directory is writable etc.

    Show the table code in the candidate list when pinyin mode is used
    
    Resolves: rhbz#1318109 - [RFE] Please show Wubi table code when in pinyin mode
    See: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1318109, https://github.com/ibus/ibus/issues/1846
    
    When using pinyin mode for a table like Wubi or Cangjie,
    the reason is probably because one does not know the
    Wubi or Cangjie code. So get that code from the table
    and display it as well to help the user learn that code.

    well,so I’ll add it.

    See: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1218023
    
    The Python documentation says:
    
     os.path.expanduser(path)
    
        On Unix and Windows, return the argument with an initial component
        of ~ or ~user replaced by that user‘s home directory.
    
        On Unix, an initial ~ is replaced by the environment variable HOME
        if it is set; otherwise the current user’s home directory is
        looked up in the password directory through the built-in module
        pwd. An initial ~user is looked up directly in the password
        directory.
    
    This helps if HOME is not set.

    Don’t strip space when parsing phrases from a source table

    When a leading invalid character is passed through, it needs to be remembered in self._prev_char
    
    When a string is committed using commit_string(), commit_string()
    remembers its last characters in self._prev_char. But when a invalid
    leading character is passed through directly to the application by
    returning False in the key event processing, that character needs to
    be remembered as well in self._prev_char.
    
    For example, when halfwidth letter mode but fullwidth punctuation mode
    is used, _convert_to_full_width() does not convert a “.”  to “。”
    if the previous character was a halfwidth digit. Probably the purpose
    of this hack is to make it easier to enter floating point number like
    “3.141”. A digit like “3” is an invalid input character for most
    Chinese tables and thus committed or passed through to the application
    immediately.  If the next character typed is “.”,
    _convert_to_full_width() checks whether the previous character was a
    halfwidth digit and if yet prevents conversion of “.” to ”。” to
    avoid getting “3。141”. Therefore, no matter whether a character
    is committed or passed through, the last character inserted into
    the application needs to be remembered.

    Change class “KeyEvent” to store the keycode as well
    
    - add the keycode to the class “KeyEvent”:
      I may need to access the keycode in tabengine._process_key_event()
      to forward a key event to the application:
    
      void ibus_engine_forward_key_event (IBusEngine         *engine,
                                          guint               keyval,
                                          guint               keycode,
                                          guint               state);
    
      if the object of the class “KeyEvent” passed to
      tabengine._process_key_event(self, key) does not contain the
      keycode anymore, I cannot properly forward a key event.
    
    - Fix the confusing naming of the member variables in the class
      “KeyEvent”: it is easier to give the member variables names like
      the parameters of the IBus API (Why self.code = keval?)

    Redesign the property menus, use sub-menus instead of toggles
    
    The toogles are very confusing, one cannot easily see to which
    mode one will switch when a toggle is clicked. When the floating panel
    is shown, tooltips explain to which mode will switch. But the floating
    panel is never shown in Gnome3, so this does not help for Gnome3.
    
    User feedback also shows that many users are confused whether the
    currently visible menu entry in case of a toggles shows the state
    which is currently used or the state one will switch to when that
    toggle is clicked.
    
    For toggles which have more than 2 values, for example the Chinese mode:
    
        0 means to show simplified Chinese only
        1 means to show traditional Chinese only
        2 means to show all characters but show simplified Chinese first
        3 means to show all characters but show traditional Chinese first
        4 means to show all characters
    
    it is tedious to change from mode 0 to mode 4 for example:
    
       Open the menu, click on the toggle, menu closes and one has
       changed to mode 1. Repeat 3 more times to get to mode 4.
    
    The new system to use sub-menus instead of toogles also agrees better
    with:
    
    https://wiki.gnome.org/AllanDay/IMEGuidelines
    
    > Avoid mutable menu items (menu items whose label changes after it has
    > been selected). Instead, consider providing two adjacent menu items
    > for the commands. Then make the items sensitive or insensitive as the
    > situation demands.
    >
    > Do not use mutable menu items to toggle a two-state setting (for
    > example, Show and Hide). Use a check box or radio buttons instead.

    Disable “onechar” (Phrase mode/Single char mode) option for non-CJK databases
    
    This option is only useful for Chinese. Some Chinese tables, for
    example wubi-jidian86 contain not only single Chinese characters but
    also longer phrases. When one wants to input a certain single
    character, longer phrases showing up as matches as well may make it
    more difficult to find the desired single character in the candidate
    list. I.e. to input single characters it may be sometimes useful to
    switch to single character mode. For non-Chinese tables, such a single
    character mode is useless.

    Disable hotkey to switch Chinese mode if database is not Chinese

    Disable auto_commit option for tables which do not have RULES
    
    Resolves: rhbz#1135759 - The rusle is broken with "Normal commit mode"
    See: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1135759
    
    If a table does not have USER_CAN_DEFINE_PHRASE=TRUE and a non-empty
    RULES, it makes no sense to use “commit to preedit” for that table.
    Therefore, for such tables, auto_commit should always be True
    (= “Direct commit mode”) and never False (= “Normal commit mode”).
    These tables have AUTO_COMMIT = TRUE in their source and this should
    never be changed by the user.
    
    “Normal commit mode”, i.e. committing to preedit makes sense only
    for tables like wubi-jidian86, wubi-haifeng86, and erbi-qs because
    only these 3 tables currently have RULES and USER_CAN_DEFINE_PHRASE=TRUE.
    For such tables, committing to preedit is used to define new
    user shortcuts semi-automatically.

    Pass IBus.KEY_KP_Enter to the application if the preedit is empty
    
    Resolves: rhbz#1133424 - With the new "rusle" table in ibus-table-cyrillic, Keypad Enter problem
    See: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1133424
    
    If IBus.KEY_KP_Enter is typed:
    
    • if the preëdit is empty, we should always pass the key to the
      application. *Not* commit an empty string plus os.linesep because
      that behaves differently in some cases.  For example when typing a
      message in Pidgin it would insert a linefeed into the message
      instead of sending the message.
    
    • if the preëdit is not empty:
      - when auto_select is true (typical for Russian input methods
        like “rusle” or “translit”), the pending preëdit should be committed
        and the IBus.KEY_KP_Enter key passed to the application.
        For example, when typing “C” with translit, the preëdit contains
        Ц because it is still possible that a “h” is typed next:
    
            C       Ц       1000
            Ch      Ч       1000
            CH      Ч       1000
    
        When IBus.KEY_KP_Enter is typed in this state, the Ц should
        be committed and the IBus.KEY_KP_Enter should be passed to the
        application. With the old code, typing “C” followed by
        IBus.KEY_KP_Enter inserted a Ц and a linefeed in Pidgin instead
        of sending the message ending with Ц.
      - when auto_select is false (typical for Chinese input methods),
        the typed tabkeys should be committed (not the Chinese characters
        in the preëdit) and IBus.KEY_KP_Enter should not be passed
        to the application.

    When porting to Python3, I originally kept it working with Python2 as

    would not work anymore with Python2.  It doesn’t seem to make sense
    to invest effort to keep Python2 compatibility. Better require Python >= 3.3.

    For cangjie* and quick* tables: Use big5 order if the freq from the table is the same
    
    In the cangjie5.txt table, all the frequency weights are 1000, for example:
    
        su  己      1000
        su  已      1000
        su         1000
        su  㔾      1000
    
    Currently, the Unicode code point is used as a last ditch fallback if
    all the other sort keys are the same (sort keys are: exact match, user
    frequency, Chinese variant, system frequency, length of input
    sequence, input sequence alphabetical, Unicode code point).
    
    In case of the above characters matching “su”, the Unicode code
    points and Big5 code points:
    
        㔾 U+353E Big5 -    Big5HKSCS 8BC8
        己 U+5DF1 Big5 A476 Big5HKSCS A476
        已 U+5DF2 Big5 A477 Big5HKSCS A477
         U+E81D Big5 -    Big5HKSCS -
    
    Sorting via the Unicode code points gives:
    
        尸山 (1/9)
        1. 㔾
        2. 己
        3. 已
        4. 
        ...
    
    And sorting first via the Big5 code points and then via the Unicode
    code points for characters which do not have a Big5 code point gives:
    
        尸山 (1/9)
        1. 己
        2. 已
        3. 㔾
        4. 
        ...
    
    This order seems to make more sense for Cangjie because:
    
    • https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big5:
      “The original Big5 character set is sorted first by usage frequency,
      second by stroke count, lastly by Kangxi radical.”
    • some other popular operating system also uses Big5 order for Cangjie
    
    Therefore, for the cangjie* and quick* tables, this commit introduces
    another sort key sorting according to the Big5 code point just before
    sorting the final sort key using the Unicode code point.
    
    As the frequency data in the tables (which is currently always 1000
    for cangjie5.txt, cangjie3.txt, and cangjie-big.txt) has higher priority,
    one could still tweak the frequency data in the table if the order is
    still not perfect for some characters. But it looks like Big5 order
    is quite reasonable.

    Make it possible to use select keys like F1, F2, F3 ...
    
    Select keys like F1, F2, F3, ... are necessary for the ipa-x-sampa
    table which has:
    
    VALID_INPUT_CHARS == +!\%&'-./0123456789:<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[]^_`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~"
    
    Therefore, using 1, 2, 3, ... as the select keys for ipa-x-sampa
    is bad because it makes it impossible to input the following
    entries of the ipa-x-sampa table:
    
        1   ɨ       0       ### U+0268 LATIN SMALL LETTER I WITH STROKE

    Also, use the key codes of the select keys instead of the names of the
    select keys in the key even processing. One could of course keep
    using the names and still make using select keys like F1, F2, F3, ...
    possible. But other similar key lists like self._commit_keys,
    self._page_up_keys, and self._page_down_keys use key codes, it seems
    nicer make all these similar key lists use the same data types.

            Don’t show the prompt characters defined in the table in pinyin mode in the auxiliary text
    
    already avoided using the prompts in pinyin mode in the auxiliary text.
    But prompt characters may also appear in the candidate list to show
    which characters are needed to complete a candidate (“remaining_tabkeys”)
    and also in the preëdit when no candidate can be found for the typed
    characters.  Fix this for pinyin mode for these cases as well.

    Tweak defaults for Chinese mode taken from the locale
    
    - detect also the locale zh_SG as simplified Chinese
    - if the Chinese variant is detected from the locale, set the
      Chinese mode to a mode which prefers a variant instead of
      showing that variant only. I.e., if zh_CN or zh_SG is in
      the locale, set the Chinese mode to 2 (“Show simplified Chinese first”)
      instead of 0 (“Show *only* simplified Chinese”).
      If one wants to show only one variant, one can easily change that
      later, but as a default it is better not to hide one variant, this
      seems to confuse some users who have not yet discovered that these
      options exist (see for example: https://code.google.com/p/ibus/issues/detail?id=1492
      and https://code.google.com/p/ibus/issues/detail?id=1670 )
    - if no Chinese locale is set (and the Chinese mode is neither set in
      the table nor in the user settings either), use mode 4 (“Show all Chinese
      characters”) by default. In this case we don’t really know whether
      the table is intended for simplified or for traditional Chinese,
      it makes no sense to just guess simplified Chinese then.

    Don’t add self._single_wildcard_char and self._multi_wildcard_char to self._valid_input_chars and self._pinyin_valid_input_chars
    
    This is because the wildcard characters can be changed with the setup
    tool at runtime. If they are added to the string of valid input
    characters, the old wildcards would need to be removed from that
    string if the wildcards are changed. But the wildcard character may
    have been in that list already before it was added as a wildcard
    character. In that case, only one instance of the old wildcard
    character should be removed from the string of valid input characters
    if the wildcard character is changed. Replacing the wildcard
    characters in the string of valid input characters when they change
    seems more confusing that not adding them to that string in the first
    place.
    
    Therefore, I do not add the wildcard characters to the string of
    valid input characters anymore, but that means that when checking
    whether a character is a valid input character
    
        if c in self._valid_input_chars:
    
    is not enough anymore, now one needs
    
        if c in self._valid_input_chars + self._single_wildcard_char + self._multi_wildcard_char:
    
    That seems less confusing than adding the wildcard characters to
    self._valid_input_chars and replacing them there when they change.

    Make wildchard characters configurable
    
    The options AUTO_WILDCARD, SINGLE_WILDCARD_CHAR, and
    MULTI_WILDCARD_CHAR are now not only configurable in the table sources
    but also in the setup tool and via dconf.
    
    The default for AUTO_WILDCARD if neither specified in the table source
    nor in the setup tool nor in dconf is TRUE, this is best for most
    tables.
    
    The defaults for SINGLE_WILDCARD_CHAR and MULTI_WILDCARD_CHAR
    are the empty strings, this means no wildcards are used.
    
    In some table sources default values for SINGLE_WILDCARD_CHAR and
    MULTI_WILDCARD_CHAR are defined, in most cases these are
    
    SINGLE_WILDCARD_CHAR = ?
    MULTI_WILDCARD_CHAR = *

    Insert a special candidate for the wildcard character itself if only a wildcard character has been typed
    
    Resolves: rhbz#1110325 - Unable to input question marks in Wubi-jidian
    See: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1110325
    
    The same problem has been also reported here:
    
        https://code.google.com/p/ibus/issues/detail?id=1720
    
    If only a wildcard character has been typed, insert a special
    candidate at the first position for the wildcard character itself. For
    example, if “?” is used as a wildcard character and this is the only
    character typed, add a candidate ('?', '?', 0, 1000000000) in
    halfwidth mode or a candidate ('?', '？', 0, 1000000000) in fullwidth
    mode.  This is needed to make it possible to input the wildcard
    characters themselves, if “?” acted only as a wildcard it would be
    impossible to input a fullwidth question mark.

    Better sorting in the mixed chinese modes

commit e18f708fd9439e51ee115b578931f624852b53af

    Better sorting of the lookup table in the mixed Chinese modes
    
    In the mixed Chinese modes 2 and 3 (simplified Chinese first and
    traditional Chinese first), the filtering for simplified and traditional
    was done as a last step filtering the candidate list already sorted
    using the sort keys:
    
        - exact match?
        - user frequency
        - system frequency
        - length of input sequence
        - alphabetical order of input sequence
        - Unicode code point of first character of matched phrase
    
    But this simplified and traditional filtering is basically just
    another sort key. Doing this after the main sorting of the candidate
    list is inefficient and does not give nice results either. It is
    better to do all of the sorting in one place.
    
    The sort key for the desired Chinese variant (traditional or simplified)
    should have higher priority than the system frequency but lower
    priority than the user frequency. If the user selects a certain variant
    often, it should be preferred in future.
    
    An example for the behaviour after this commit is applied:
    
    wubi-jidian86.txt contains the following matches for 語
    (as a single character):
    
        ygkg        語      204000000
    
    It contains the following matches for 语 (as a single character):
    
        ygk 语      234000000
        ygkg        语      234000000
    
    And the following matches for the input sequence “ygkg”:
    
        ygkg        語      204000000
        ygkg        语      234000000
        ygkg        𢌐      0
        ygkg        𣄟      0
        ygkg        𩐕      0
    
    After this commit, typing “ygkg” gives the following results in the
    lookup table (when all user frequencies are 0. For testing this
    can be achieved by removing the user database):
    
    Chinese mode 0, “simplified Chinese only”:
    ==========================================
    
    ygkg (1/4)
    1. 语 234000000 0

    Do not create useless indexes
    
    Resolves: rhbz#1105465 - Please avoid to create sqlite table index in ibus-table
    See: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1105465
    
    Most of indexes which were created were not helpful at all because
    most queries are done using the SQL “LIKE” operator which does
    not benefit from indexes.
    
    And the SELECT statements which do not use “LIKE” are not doing anything
    where speed is critical. So we could not find a benefit in any
    of the existing indexes. Benchmarking showed no significant difference
    between having the indexes or not having them.
    
    I changed the functions create_indexes() and drop_indexes() to do
    nothing, if we ever find that some index is really useful, we can
    easily add it again.
    
    Not creating the indexes saves a lot of space:

    Add wildcard support also to pinyin mode
    
    The wildcards used are the same as for table mode. I.e. if
    the table defines:
    
        MULTI_WILDCARD_CHAR = *
        SINGLE_WILDCARD_CHAR = ?
    
    the same wildcards are used for pinyin as well.
    
    The AUTO_WILDCARD in the table is ignored for pinyin mode though, it
    is always treated as AUTO_WILDCARD = TRUE for pinyin mode, FALSE
    does not make any sense for pinyin mode.

Author: Mike FABIAN <mfabian@redhat.com>
Date:   Tue Jun 3 16:43:04 2014 +0200

    Add support for wildcards
    
    The options
    
    AUTO_WILDCARD, MULTI_WILDCARD_CHAR, and SINGLE_WILDCARD_CHAR
    are now read from the table and used.
    
    The defaults are:
    
        AUTO_WILDCARD = TRUE
        MULTI_WILDCARD_CHAR = *
        SINGLE_WILDCARD_CHAR = ?
    
    Now one can use wildcards as in the following example for cangjie5:
    “cangjie5.txt” contains:
    
        sqsf        馬      1000
    
    Now typing something like “s*f” or “s?sf” will match 馬.
    
    If AUTO_WILDCARD = TRUE, a multi wildcard character will always
    be appended to the user input, for example typing “s” will
    match like “s*”. Until now, ibus-table was always working like that.
    Now it is possible to set AUTO_WILDCARD = FALSE to avoid that
    automatic final wildcard and get only exact matches. This is
    very rarely useful though, take care with that option, in most

    Exact matches at the top and support prompts for cangjie

commit 063a61ae9923de14ce880a1a444af81cff22e00e
Author: Mike FABIAN <mfabian@redhat.com>
Date:   Wed May 28 18:38:31 2014 +0200

    Add the Unicode code point of the first character of the phrase as a last ditch sort key for the candidates
    
    In some cases, where there are several matches for *exactly* the same
    input sequences *and* the system frequencies are also the same
    for example
    
        bmr 同      1000
        bmr 𦚈      1000
    
    in cangjie5.txt, instead of getting the order randomly, use the
    Unicode code point as a last ditch sort key. Some defined order is
    better than random. On top of that, this puts characters with code
    points above the BMP *after* characters with code points in the
    BMP. Usually this is the right thing to do because the characters from
    the BMP are usually more common. Should this not be the case and the
    character above the BMP really is the more common one, the system
    frequency should be added to reflect this.
    
    This does not always help: In cangjie5.txt there are also cases where
    *exactly* the same input sequences matches different characters which
    are all in the BMP, for example:
    
        bmso        豚      1000
        bmso        冢      1000
        bmso        䐁      1000
    
        dhe 皮      1000
        dhe 板      1000
    
    But sorting the characters in the BMP to the top if all other sort
    keys are the same is better than nothing.

    Add a “setup” property
    
    Apparently that was planned already, there was a comment which
    said “Need implementation”.
    
    I also think it is a good idea, especially under Gnome3 the setup for
    the input methods is quite difficult to reach, one has to start the
    “gnome-control-centre” first, then go to the “region” part, then
    to the input method, then click on the cogwheel icon. That is quite
    inconvenient if the setup is used regularly.
    
    If one wanted to reduce the number of entries in the properties, I
    think it would be better to remove other properties which are probably
    not used all the time and are available in the setup anyway.  I guess
    the properties “Phrase mode/Single character mode”, “Direct commit
    mode/Normal commit mode” and “Display candidates/Hide candidates”
    are probably very rarely used and it might be good enough if they are
    accessible only in the setup tool.

    Do not check whether the name in “NAME = ...” is a valid gconf key
    
    It is not used as a gconf key anyway. We use the basename of the table
    file as the gconf key, i.e. for
    
        /usr/share/ibus-table/tables/wubi-jidian86.db
    
    the gconf key is “wubi-jidian86”. The gconf key should be more or
    less constant, it should not change often. If it changes during an
    update, the old user settings may be lost.
    
       NAME =
    
    in the table source is more suitable for display to the user,
    here one can write a nice, user readable string.
    
    In the lastest master of ibus-table-chinese, wubi-jidian86.txt contains:
    
        NAME = WuBi-Jidian (JiShuag) 86
        NAME.zh_CN = 极点五笔（极爽字库）86
        NAME.zh_TW = 極點五筆（極爽字庫）86
        NAME.zh_HK = 極點五筆（極爽字庫）86
    
    which made tabcreatedb.py fail because it checked whether
    NAME is a valid gconf key. But we do not need that check.

    If the user sets the dconf key “lookuptablepagesize” to a value < 1
    or > len(self._editor._select_keys), set it to a valid value again in

    which has only 9 select keys (SELECT_KEYS = 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9), the
    dconf key is set to 9 again and the slider moves back to 9.

    space key behaviour. But this commit makes the existing option work
    which is enough for the moment.

    Add “auto_select” option to setup tool
    
    This option has a very misleading name. It does not really automatically
    select anything.
    
    When set to “True” does the following things:
    
    1) commit the matched phrase and a line feed instead of the tabkeys
       and no line feed when Return is typed (apparently Chinese input
       methods like Wubi want to insert the tabkeys instead of the phrase
       on Return, this is used as a quick way to insert one Latin word
       without having to switch to direct input mode or another input
       method. But for non-Chinese input methods like the Russian
       “translit”, this makes of course no sense).
    
    2) commit the matched phrase when Tab is typed
    
    3) When committing by typing Space, commit the phrase followed by a
       “ ” instead of only the phrase.
    
    4) if typing a valid input character has the result that there are no
       candidates anymore, but there were candidates before typing that
       character, pop that character from the input again, commit the
       first of the previous candidates and then reprocess the input
       character.  This is also mainly needed for non-Chinese input
       methods like the Russian “translit”. The “translit” table
       contains:
    
         sh ш
         shh щ
    
       so typing “sh” matches “ш” and “щ”. The
       candidate with the shortest key sequence comes
       first in the lookup table, therefore “sh ш”
       is shown in the preëdit (The other candidate,
       “shh щ” comes second in the lookup table and
       could be selected using arrow-down. But
       “translit” hides the lookup table by default).
    
       Now, when after typing “sh” one types “s”,
       the key “shs” has no match, so add_input('s')
       returns “False” and we end up here. We pop the
       last character “s” which caused the match to
       fail, commit first of the previous candidates,
       i.e. “sh ш” and feed the “s” into the
       key event handler again.
    
    Maybe this option should be renamed because the name is really misleading?
    Maybe even split it in several options, maybe even a separate option
    for each of 1), 2), 3), and 4)?

    Make the setup tool get the default from the database for settings which are not yet set in dconf
    
    The setup tool gets the the values for the options to
    show when it starts up from the following 3 places now:
    
       1) dconf setting for this table
       2) database of this table
       3) Python dictionary OPTION_DEFAULTS in main.py of setup.
    
    So it prefers dconf settings, then the database, and finally the
    hardcoded values in the setup tool itself.
    
    Before this change it did fall back immediately to the hardcoded
    values OPTION_DEFAULTS if a setting was not yet set in dconf.
    I.e. it showed exactly the same defaults for all tables.
    
    But the defaults in the databases of the tables are usually there for
    a reason and they should of course be presented to the user before he
    first changes something in the setup tool.

    Remove commented out line resetting self._editor_onechar in reset()
    
    The “onechar” option is even remembered in the config, it makes no
    sense to reset it in reset(). It was commented out of course already,
    but better remove it completely there to avoid confusion.

    Add options to setup for fullwidth and halfwidth mode for direct input mode
    
    There are such options for “Table input” already but not for
    “Direct input”.  But even for “Direct input”, when the fullwidth
    or halfwidth mode is changed using the property menu, the change is
    saved to the config and remembered, just as for “Table input”. There
    seems to be no reason for this is kind of “asymmetric” behaviour.
    So I added these options for “Direct mode” to the setup as well.

    Improve texts in properties and setup
    
    - show “Table mode” ↔ “Pinyin mode” property only when the table
      really has a pinyin mode.
    
    - fix wrong key bindings mentioned in tooltip texts of properties.
    
    - improve texts of properties and in the setup tool.

    The combobox in the setup tool which was labelled “Language:”
    and had the values “Chinese” and “English” did not do anything at all.
    
    Fix this and improve the names of the label, the options, and the variables
    to reflect better what it does.

    When auto_commit is used and there is only one candidate, commit only when the typed characters match the tabkeys of the candidate completely
    
    Much better for non-Chinese tables like “latex”, “ipa-x-sampa”, ...
    
    For example, consider that “latex” table contains the following
    lines matching “\al”:
    
        \alpha α
        \aleph ℵ
    
    And the default for the “latex” table is to use auto_commit.
    That means that with the old code, after typing “\alp”,
    only the single candidate
    
        \alpha α
    
    matched and was committed immediately. That is annoying because this
    makes it necessary to look at the screen. It is easy to remember that
    “\alpha” means α in LaTeX and if these are commited only when typed
    completely, one does not have to look at the screen to type α. It is
    much harder to remember how many characters of \alpha one has to type
    to get a unique match. Of course committing at “\alp” already saves
    two key strokes. But even with the new code one can save a few
    keystrokes if one looks at the screen: Just type “\al”, notice that
    α is the first candidate, then commit it with space.
    
    The new code also avoids the distinction between Chinese/non-Chinese here:
    In a Chinese table, when
    
        len(self._editor._chars_valid) == self._max_key_length
    
    *and* there is only one candidate, it follows that the tabkeys
    for this candidate have been typed completely. That means
    one can just as well do the same check as for non-Chinese tables,
    i.e.
    
       self._editor._chars_valid == self._editor._candidates[0][0]
    
    instead of checking whether the maximum key length is reached.

    Rewrite update_candidates()
    
    - simplify code in update_candidates()
    
    - remember both the valid and invalid characters when update_candidates()
      was last called and return immediately only when *both* are unchanged
      (Fixes a problem when removing invalid characters with backspace).
    
    - simplify add_input()
    
    - simplify section to handle valid input characters in key event handler
    
    - remove self._tabkeys, it is *always* identical to self._chars_valid

    auto_commit_to_preedit() is not needed
    
    There is no significant difference between auto_commit_to_preedit()
    and commit_to_preedit().
    
    The only difference seems to be that auto_commit_to_preedit() tries to
    commit even when self._chars_valid is empty and even when
    self._candidates is empty. But in that case it will just fail with an
    “index out of range” error. To catch this, auto_commit_to_preedit()
    uses a “try: ... except: ...”  instead of checking whether
    self._candidates is empty like commit_to_preedit() does, that seems
    to be the only real difference.

    Remove redundant code when processing leading invalid input

commit be3be5d02ddd491f16be93e94753064d9321d1c9
Author: Mike FABIAN <mfabian@redhat.com>
Date:   Tue May 13 17:09:47 2014 +0200

    Fix handling of invalid trailing input
    
    - Improve documentation of _table_mode_process_key_event()
    
    - If invalid input characters came after some valid input characters,
      the old code committed the valid input and then the invalid
      character only if the key code of the invalid input was <= 127.
      Consider for example, for the cns11643 table, the valid input is
      “0123456789abcdef”.  The Chinese character “一” has the table
      key “14421” in cns11643, it is the first character in that table
      with a key starting with “1442”.
    
      Both “A” and “☺” are invalid input for the cns11643 table. But
      as “A” has a key code <= 127, it would be committed after
      committing pending input whereas “☺” which has a key code > 127
      would be passed through to the application.
      Therefore, typing “1442A” would commit “一A” but
      typing “1442☺” would pass “☹” to the application and keep
      “1442” in preedit, so the user sees “☺1442”.
    
      This makes no sense at all, instead of checking for <= 127, *all*
      typed keys where “IBus.keyval_to_unicode(key.code)”
      returns a result should be treated the same way here. Then
      typing “1442☺” commits “一☺”.
    
    - The added lines:
    
          if type(keychar) != type(u''):
              keychar = keychar.decode('UTF-8')
    
      are only for Python2 compatibility, they do nothing for Python3.
      (Maybe I should give up trying to keep Python2 compatibility?)

    Improve readability in _table_mode_process_key_event()
    
    - Try not to use extremely long lines so much
    - more consistent use of parentheses
    - No need to check for “and(not self._editor._py_mode)” in
      “if key.code <32 ...”, pinyin mode does surely not use
      key codes < 32 either.
    - document why the Tab key is passed through to the application
      when auto select is used.
    
    Don’t use a very long chain of
    
        if ...:
            ...
            return True
            ...
            return False
        elif ...:
            ...  <- jumps to the final “return False” here
        elif ...:
            ...
            return True
        elif ...:
            ...
            return True
        return False
    
    rather use
    
        if ...:
            ...
            return True
            ...
            return False

        if ...:
            ...
            return True
        return False
    
    That makes it easier to see immediately what is returned without
    always having to remember that there is a final “return False” at
    the end.

    There was a function space() which was not only used when committing

    Rename get_all_input_strings() to get_preedit_tabkeys_complete()
    
    To get the strings (= phrases) in the preëdit as parts are complete
    there are:
    
        get_preedit_string_parts()
        get_preedit_string_complete()
    
    For the functions to get the typed key sequences belonging
    to phrases in the preëdit, there were:
    
        get_preedit_tabkeys_parts()
        get_all_input_strings()
    
    which is a bit inconsistent. Better make it
    
        get_preedit_tabkeys_parts()
        get_preedit_tabkeys_complete()
    
    then the naming is more symmetric and it also describes better what it
    actually does (Because if strings in the preëdit have been
    split, get_preedit_tabkeys_complete() does not necessarily return the
    exact key sequence the user typed as the key sequences for the split
    phrases will have been recalculated)

    Committing with the mouse or by typing Control+Number should not define new abbreviations
    
    I avoided defining new abbreviations when committing by typing
    “space” already, see:
    
        commit 56796c39c92697d4fcd233e42ebe8f208f0e1324
        Author: Mike FABIAN <mfabian@redhat.com>
        Date:   Wed May 7 14:07:56 2014 +0200
    
            Don’t define new abbreviations automatically
    
            For example, the latex table system database contains:
    
                \alpha|α|0|0
    
            If one types “\alp” and then selects the candidate “α”
            from the lookup table, do *not* automatically create
            (or update) an abbreviated entry
    
                \alp|α|0|1
    
            in the user database, instead create (or update) an entry using the
            full length of the tabkeys:
    
                \alpha|α|0|1
    
            Creating shortcuts automatically like this is useful in
            ibus-typing-booster but it seems useless and confusing in ibus-table.
    
    but it didn’t work when committing using Control+Number because
    the code for Control+Number got the input key sequence *before*
    committing to preedit and at this point it may not yet be the complete
    input key sequence of a candidate. During commit to preëdit, the
    really typed input key sequence is replaced by the input key sequence
    of the selected candidate, which may be longer.
    
    Committing with the mouse inherited this error from the code copied
    from committing with Control+Number.

    There is no need to check for differences in pinyin mode before and after commit_string() or editor.clear()
    
    commit_string() calls editor.clear() and clear() used to switch
    off pinyin mode. But we stopped doing that, see:

            Don’t switch off pinyin mode in clear()
    
            clear() is called in do_focus_out().  And do_focus_out() is called
            after clicking into the gnome menu to switch to pinyin mode.  This
            makes it almost impossible to enable pinyin mode and keep it when
            pinyin mode is switched off in clear().
    
    Therefore, there is no need to check whether the pinyin mode has
    changed after commit_string() or editor.clear() anymore.

    Show the list of possible input key sequences for characters in the preëdit not only for pinyin
    
    If there are no input strings at the moment but there are strings
    committed to preëdit, some information about these may be shown in the
    auxiliary text.
    
    If the last character committed to preëdit was typed by using pinyin
    mode, a list of possible input sequences how this character could be
    typed using the current table (e.g. wubi-jidian86) was shown.  This
    way, one can type a character using pinyin, commit it to preëdit and
    then see which table input key sequences could have been used to type
    the same character.
    
    It doesn’t really make sense to limit this to the last typed
    character and only if it has been typed using pinyin. Showing these
    table codes always is better.

    Do not hide the auxiliary text when there are no candidates, it might contain useful information
    
    The auxiliary text may contain useful information even when there are
    no candidates.
    
    For example, when committing a few characters to
    preëdit to define a user defined phrase, the auxiliary text shows
    what key sequence will be defined for that phrase.
    For example, when wubi-jidian86 is used and the phrase
    
        “王不各”
    
    is commited to preëdit and no further input is currently there, the
    auxiliary text shows
    
        “#: ggtk”
    
    Here “ggtk” is the key sequence which will be defined for that phrase,
    i.e. in future one can type “ggtk” to input “王不各”.
    
    The auxiliary text also shows the table keys if the last character
    committed to preëdit has been typed using pinyin. For example,
    if one uses wubi-jidian86 and has forgotten the table codes for
    
        你
    
    one can type it using pinyin by switching to pinyin mode (with the menu
    or the right shift key), type “ni + Shift + 3” to get 你, commit it
    to preëdit by selecting it with Control+Number in the lookup table,
    then the wubi-jidian86 table codes for 你 are displayed in the auxiliary
    text:
    
        wq wqi wqiy

    Use an integer self._cursor_precommit instead of an array self._cursor[]
    
    self._cursor[1] is never used anymore after my rewrite of the cursor
    movement code because I split the strings committed to preëdit already
    when the cursor is moved and not in add_input() anymore, so there is
    no need to keep track of a second cursor position.

    Don’t define new abbreviations automatically
    
    For example, the latex table system database contains:
    
        \alpha|α|0|0
    
    If one types “\alp” and then selects the candidate “α”
    from the lookup table, do *not* automatically create
    (or update) an abbreviated entry
    
        \alp|α|0|1
    
    in the user database, instead create (or update) an entry using the
    full length of the tabkeys:
    
        \alpha|α|0|1
    
    Creating shortcuts automatically like this is useful in
    ibus-typing-booster but it seems useless and confusing in ibus-table.

    Fix cursor movements in the strings committed to preëdit
    
    Rewrite most of the code for cursor movements in the preëdit because
    it did not work at all.
    
    The old non-working code tried to use wrap around when the cursor
    reached the ends of the preëdit. I think that is confusing
    and implemented it without wrap around.
    
    When there are strings committed to preëdit and a space is typed
    while the current input is empty, the preëdit should be committed
    (this was broken).

    Fix find_zi_code, it should return a list of possible tabkeys for a phrase
    
    The documentation “Check word freq and user_freq” was very misleading.
    
    Actually it should return a list of possible tabkeys for a phrase.
    For example, if “phrase” is “你” and the table is wubi-jidian.86.txt,
    the result will be ['wq', 'wqi', 'wqiy'] because that table
    contains the following 3 lines matching that phrase exactly:
    
    wq      你      597727619
    wqi     你      1490000000

    Handle start characters correctly
    
    Some tables (currently the “latex” table is the only one I know of)
    have special “start characters”. For example, in the latex table,
    the start character is “\”, i.e. every key in that table starts with
    a “\”, if the first character typed is anything else but “\”, no
    match is possible and therefore the typed character should be directly
    committed or directly passed to the application without attempting
    a match in the table.

    to correctly keep it in sync with the other variables containing

    Instead of returning a complicated string in get_preedit_strings() and
    parse it again into parts using regular expressions in
    _update_preedit(), rather return a tuple of the parts
    _update_preedit() needs.
    
    Rename the function returning these parts from get_preedit_strings()
    to get_preedit_string_parts() and add a function
    get_preedit_string_complete() which joins these parts and is used
    where the distinction of the parts is not necessary.

    over_input() should not clear self._u_chars[]
    
    It does this only to cause a weird side effect in
    get_preedit_strings().  But that is quite nonsensical, get_predit_strings()
    and _update_preedit() should be rewritten not to depend on this.
    
    Clearing only self._u_chars[] but not self._strings[] makes these
    two arrays have different lengths, but they should always have
    the same length.
    
    if clearing self._u_chars[] is removed from over_input(),
    over_input() becomes useless as it only calls clear_input() now
    and it can be removed.

    self._strings and self._u_chars should always have the same length
    
    As self._strings and self._u_chars *always* should have the same
    length, there is no need to check “if self._strings” before
    self._strings.pop() if self._u_chars is already known to be not
    empty. Of course the extra check doesn’t hurt, but if self._strings
    and self._u_chars ever happen to have a different length, I want it to
    fail and then figure out how this could happen.

    Rename self._chars_valid to self._chars_valid_when_update_candidates_was_last_called
    
    Long name, but this makes the purpose of that variable clear.
    It is used *only* to make update_candidates() return fast when
    nothing has really changed.
    
    If the users input characters have not changed, usually no update_candidates()
    is necessary, but there are some exceptional cases for example when
    deleting a candidate from the user database when the candidate
    list changes while the user input has not changed. In these exceptional
    cases, an update of the lookup table needs to be forced.

    Fix remove_cand_from_userdb() and rename it to remove_candidate_from_user_database()
    
    After the database redesign, tabsqlitedb.remove_phrase() takes
    named arguments “tabkeys” and “phrase” instead of a complete candidate
    as an array.
    
    Also, instead of deleting a candidate from the user database only
    if it is user defined and thus not in the system database (candidates
    which have freq=-1 in the user database are user defined), delete
    the candidate always, if it is in the user database at all.
    
    This way, the user can not only use this function to remove user defined
    candidates but also to lower the priority of candidates which are
    already in the system database and have aquired a high priority by
    being used. Removing these candidates from the user database lowers
    their priority again.

    Remove unused functions get_invalid_input_chars() and get_invalid_input_string()

    Change the design of the database
    
    The old database used columns like
    
        id|mlen|clen|m0|m1|m2|m3|m4|category|phrase|freq|user_freq
    
    where “m0”, “m1”, “m2”, “m3”, “m4” did hold individual
    characters of the input string which was therefore limited to a fixed
    maximum (could be different for each table). In this case the maximum
    is 5 characters. “mlen” was the length of the input string actually
    used, for example if the input string was “adlt”, then “mlen = 3”,
    “m0 = a”, “m1 = d”, “m2 = l”, “m3 = t”, and “m4 = None”.
    “clen” was the length of the Chinese phrase matching this input
    string, for example, if “adlt” is the input string for the Chinese
    phrase “苦力”, then “clen = 2”. “category” was a bitmask
    indicating whether that Chinese phrase is simplified Chinese,
    traditional Chinese, used in both variants of Chinese, or is a mixture
    of simplified and traditional Chinese. Non-Chinese tables lacked that
    “category” column.
    
    I.e. in this example the database row in system database for the old
    design would have looked like:
    
        345|4|2|a|d|l|t|None|1|苦力|3600000|0
    
    (“345” is an abitrary row-id)
    
    The new database now uses only:
    
        id|tabkeys|phrase|freq|user_freq
    
    “tabkeys” is the combination of “m0” ... “m4”, it is of type TEXT
    and has no artificial limit (except the limit imposed by sqlite, which
    is huge). So the row in the above example would look like this in
    the new database design:
    
        345|adlt|苦力|3600000|0
    
    “mlen” and “clen” have been removed, they just duplicate
    information, the lengths can be calculated easily when
    needed. “category” has been removed as well, it can be calculated
    fast and easy at runtime, there is no need to save this at build time
    into the system database. Omitting “category” also makes the columns
    used in Chinese and non-Chinese databases identical, avoiding lots of
    special cases for Chinese and non-Chinese in the code.

    Don’t filter candidates in pinyin mode
    
    I may change that again later, but currently the format of the
    candidate tuples in pinyin mode is different from the format in
    non-pinyin mode which makes this filtering fail. Therefore, pinyin
    mode would not work at all at the moment if Chinese mode 2 or 3 is
    selected.

    Remove tabdict
    
    Do not translate the typed characters into integers with tabdict.
    Use the characters themselves instead.
    
    Translating characters to integers doesn’t make anything faster,
    just more complicated.
    
    Even if a translation to integers were desirable, why use a custom
    table and not the Unicode code points? A custom table always
    needs to be extended when more characters are allowed as valid
    input characters.

    which tries to match single Chinese characters as a sequence of 3
    bytes does not match anymore after the Python3 port because Python
    strings are always unicode now and each Chinese character is thus a
    single character in a string.

    If keychar is empty, do not treat it as valid input
    
    This makes typing the right shift key toggle between pinyin mode and
    table mode, as intended.
    
    In Python
    
        >>> '' in 'abc'
        True
    
    Therefore, “keychar in self._valid_input_char” is True even if
    keychar is empty. But if keychar is empty, one should not treat it
    as valid input.
    
    This problem occured when pressing Shift-Right, it was treated
    as valid input and the following traceback was seen:

    In pinyin mode, there are no user defined phrases.  Therefore, the
    array holding a candidate does not have two integers at the end, only
    one. candi[-2] is already the phrase, i.e. the chinese character in
    pinyin mode, not an integer specifying a frequency.

    Make usage of engine name and dconf key consistent
    
    The setup tool did write to a different dconf key than the
    engine.
    
    Make this consistent. If the file name of the table is
    
        /usr/share/ibus-table/tables/wubi-jidian86.db
    
    use
    
       table:wubi-jidian
    
    as the ibus engine name (listed by “ibus list-engine” and used
    in the environment variable IBUS_ENGINE_NAME).
    
    As the dconf key, use:
    
        /desktop/ibus/engine/table/wubi-jidian86
    
    The name found in the source of the table (i.e. in wubi-jidian86.txt
    in the source package of ibus-table-chinese), which looks like
    
        ### The default name of this table
        NAME = WuBi-Jidian (JiShuag) 86
    
    should not be used for the dconf key or the engine name, it should
    only be used for display in the user interface.

    Add a .desktop file and make the setup tool work with Gnome
    
    Previously, the setup tool could be called from the command
    line, for example:
    
        /usr/libexec/ibus-setup-table cangjie3
        /usr/libexec/ibus-setup-table wubi-jidian86
        ...
    
    But it could not be called from “gnome-control-center region”,
    not setup icon did appear for the ibus-table engines.
    
    To make this work, a desktop files
    
        /usr/share/applications/ibus-setup-{...}.desktop
    
    need to be added where {...} is the engine name up to the first “:”
    character. When the engine names are just the table names
    (“cangjie3”, “wubi-jidian86”, ...), each table would need to
    supply its own .desktop file
    
        /usr/share/applications/ibus-setup-cangjie3.desktop
        /usr/share/applications/ibus-setup-wubi-jidian86.desktop
        ...
    
    That is not nice, especially as many tables are in different rpm packages.
    It is better to have just a single .desktop file
    
        /usr/share/applications/ibus-setup-table.desktop
    
    This can be used for all engines if the ibus engine names are changed like:
    
        cangjie3 → table:cangjie3
        wubi-jidian86 → table:wubi-jidian86
        ...
    
    because only the part before the first “:” in the ibus engine name
    is used by gnome to decide which desktop file to use.
    
    The desktop file contains a line like:
    
        Exec=/usr/libexec/ibus-setup-table
    
    and the setup tool is is called by Gnome without any command line
    arguments. But Gnome sets the enviromnent variable IBUS_ENGINE_NAME
    to the engine name when calling the setup tool.
    
    So I changed the setup tool to work like this:
    
        IBUS_ENGINE_NAME=table:cangjie3 /usr/libexec/ibus-setup-table
    
    or
    
        /usr/libexec/ibus-setup-table --engine-name table:cangjie
    
    (The command line option is preferred over the environment variable
    when both are given).

    Port ibus-table from Python2 to Python3
    
    I kept it working with Python2 for the moment, but in the long run
    it is probably not worth the maintenance effort to keep it working
    with Python2.
    
    - I added stuff like
    
         if type(s) != type(u''):
             s = s.decode('UTF-8')
    
      for compatibility with Python2.
    
      http://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.3.html says:
    
      > • The u'unicode' syntax is accepted again for str objects.
    
      So the above compatibility hack does not work for Python3 < 3.3.
    
    - define our own compatibility function
    
        def ascii_ispunct(character):
            if character in '''!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~''':
                return True
            else:
                return False
      instead of using ascii.ispunct() from “from curses import ascii”
      to get the intended behaviour both in Python2 and Python3:

Date:   Tue Feb 4 15:52:45 2014 +0100

    Make the property “Display Candidates/Hide Candidates” actually work
    
    - There is no set_candidates_list_visible() in ibus 1.5.5.
      use hide_lookup_table() instead to hide the candidates if requested
    - also hide the auxiliary text if hiding of the candidates is requested
    - make changing of that property by changing the gconf key work
      (name == u'AlwaysShowLookup' won’t work it needs to be all lower case)
    - There was a typo here: “self._new_property(u'always_show_loopup')”
      (“lookup”, not “loopup”)
    - The property menus show the current state, not the state which will
      be switched to when the menu entry is pressed. For example,
      one property says “Half-width punctuation” when half-width punctuation
      is in use, clicking it switches to full-width punctuation and
      then the menu displays “Full-width punctuation”. The property menu
      for displaying and hiding candidates did that reversed. Make it
      behave like the other property menus do.

    Changes in dconf values now get applied immediately
    
    Changing values of dconf keys for example with
    
       dconf write /desktop/ibus/engine/table/cangjie3/chinesemode 3
    
    was not applied immediately to the ibus-table engine, only
    when changing to a different input method and back this
    change was applied.
    
    This commit fixes this problem.

    Preedit needs to be updated on page-up and page-down
    
    When paging through the lookup table, the preedit needs to be updated
    to show the phrase selected by the cursor in the lookup table. Before
    this patch, the preedit was not updated and when commiting the
    character selected in the lookup table suddenly replaced the character
    in the preedit. This differed from the behaviour when moving through
    the lookup table with the arrow-up and arrow-down keys.
    Using page-up and page-down or the arrow icons at the bottom
    of the lookup table should also update the preedit just like it
    is done when the arrow-up and arrow-down keys are used.

    Improve detection of simplified and traditional Chinese
    
    Resolves:  #857967 https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=857967
    
    see also http://code.google.com/p/ibus/issues/detail?id=1492
    “unable to write 晞 with any of the two Wubi input methods”
    晞 (wubi code = JQDH) cannot be written.
    
    - add a script generate-chinese-variants.py which parses
      Unihan_Variants.txt from the Unihan database and generates another
      Python script.  The generated Python script contains a hash table
      with information which characters are simplified, which
      characters are traditional and which characters are both and
      a small function using that hash table to detect whether a string
      is traditional or simplified Chinese or both.
    - use the generated script and function in tabsqlitedb.py instead
      of the old way to distinguish between simplified and tradtional
      Chinese which used test encoding to legacy encodings like gb2312
      and big5hkscs.
    
    The new way of simplified/traditional detection should give
    better results. 晞 from issue 1492 is now classified as both
    traditional and simplified Chinese, not only traditional as it
    was with the old detection code.

    Fix typo in self._chinese_mode variable
    
    When porting to GObjectIntrospection, I made a typing mistake
    in the self._chinese_mode variable. This caused a problem when
    the dconf key for “chinesemode” was not yet set. Then the property
    for selecting the Chinese mode in the ibus menu was empty and
    and selecting the empty line with the mouse just caused an error.
    
    This commit fixes this.

    Fill input panel on demand. Huge GUI respond speedup
    
    Huge speedup on ibus-table GUI repsond time when using a large phrases
    table.
    
    Currently, all the candidate phrases are created in the input panel
    before shown to the users, while only 6 of the candidates actually show
    up on the panel. For a phrase table with a lot of phrases, the candidate
    list can contain more than 3000 entries, especially when only the 1st
    key is entried.
    
    3000 candidates will cause 3000 input widgets being generated before the
    first 6 candidates were show to the users. This can make the GUI update
    lagging up to a few seconds depending on the speed of the CPU. This is
    at least O(n).
    
    In this optimzed code, only 6 candidate widgets were generated at a
    time. More candidate widgets will be generate on next-page/previous-
    page action. Now we are O(1) for the GUI part of panel update.

    Fix ipa-x-sampa table and phrases containing spaces in emoji-table
    
    Currently there is a regular expression which filters out several
    lines defining valid phrases. The emoji-table for example has phrases
    containing spaces which are currently filtered out and the ipa-x-sampa
    table has trailing comments which are filtered out as well.
    
    In phrase_parser, the phrases are parsed like:
    
    xingma, phrase, freq = unicode (l, "utf-8").strip ().split ('\t')[:3]
    
    Therefore, it seems reasonable to change the regular expression checking
    for a table line containing a phrase definition to accept every
    line which has 3 columns seperated by tabs followed optionally
    by more columns also separated by tabs (the optional columns are ignored,
    i.e. they are just comments in the table source).

    Improve check whether a phrase is simplified or traditional Chinese
    
    The improvement is to ignore all non-Han characters when
    doing the check.
    
    This is to avoid classifying a simplified Chinese string as
    traditional just because it happens to include some non-Chinese
    characters, for example box drawing characters, which cannot be
    converted to gb2312 but happen to be convertible to big5hkscs.
    
    This fixes the problem in the emoji-table input method that most
    phrases cannot be input at all.

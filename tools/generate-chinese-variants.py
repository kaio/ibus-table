# Unihan_Variants.txt contains the following 2 lines:
#
# U+50DE  kSimplifiedVariant      U+4F2A
# U+50DE  kTraditionalVariant     U+507D U+50DE
#
# This seems to be currently the only case in Unihan_Variants.txt where
# a character which has entries for kTraditionalVariant and
# the same character is listed again among the traditional variants
# is *not* simplified Chinese.
#
# U+50DE 僞 is traditional Chinese.
# U+507D 偽 is also traditional Chinese.
# U+4F2A 伪 is simplified Chinese
#
# This does not cause a problem with the current parsing code
# of Unihan_Variants.txt because the line
#
# U+50DE  kSimplifiedVariant      U+4F2A
#
# is read first and thus the character is already inserted in the
# “VARIANTS_TABLE_ORIG” dictionary as traditional Chinese, which is correct.
# If a character is already in the dictionary and more lines for the
# same character are read from Unihan_Variants.txt, these extra lines
# are ignored.
#
# But maybe for some corner cases more tweaking of the code is
# necessary. One can also add overrides manually to the
# initial content of “VARIANTS_TABLE_ORIG”.
